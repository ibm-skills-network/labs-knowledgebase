# Cloud IDE

Cloud IDE is an online integrated development environment that closely mimics Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It offers users a familiar interface and functionality, making it accessible to those already comfortable with VS Code. This cloud-based platform supports VS Code plugins and provides a comprehensive set of development tools. Users can access their development environment from any location, eliminating the need for local installation. Cloud IDE is designed as a learning environment, but the skills and familiarity gained here are directly transferable to Visual Studio Code. This design ensures that learners can easily transition from educational projects to professional development work, bridging the gap between learning and real-world application in the software development industry.

### Layout

#### Right side: 
The Cloud IDE development environment resides here, providing the tools for code development and execution.

#### Left side: 
This area is divided into two sections:
 - Tai's Chat Interface: This interface facilitates communication between the learner and Tai, featuring chat history, and learners' message input field.
 - Lab instructions: These instructions guide learners through the learning activities and exercises.

## Cloud IDE Features

Cloud IDE empowers learners with a comprehensive IDE experience, including:
 - File/folder management: Organize and manage files and folders efficiently.
 - Terminal: Execute commands and interact with the underlying operating system.

### Skills Network Toolbox:

Within Cloud IDE, learners can access the Skills Network Toolbox by clicking the Skills Network Toolbox Icon button located on the left-hand side of the Cloud IDE menu bar. This toolbox offers a variety of tools to enhance the learning experience and facilitate completion of labs:

- Databases
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Cassandra
  - MongoDB
- Big Data
  - Apache Airflow
- Cloud
  - Code Engine
- Embeddable AI
  - Text-To-Speech
  - Speech-To-Text
  - Watson NLP
    - Sentiment Analysis (BERT and CNN)
    - Categories
    - Classification
    - Concepts
    - Detag
    - Emotion
    - Keywords
    - Lang-detect
    - Noun-phrases
    - Relations (Transformer)
    - Syntax
- Launch Application - This is how you view the application you run within Cloud IDE. The **Launch Application** button lets you view applications running inside the Cloud IDE. It starts a proxy server that makes your local app accessible through the IDE. You can use either the built-in live server or a framework-specific server (e.g., Flask for Python, Express for Node.js).

  - How to use:

    - **Start your server**
      - If you use the built-in live server, a notification will display the port that was opened.  

    - Go to **Skills Network Toolbox**, access **Launch Application** and input the port.

    - **Access your application:**  
      - Click **Your Application** to open the server inside the Cloud IDE, or  
      - Open it in a new browser tab.
