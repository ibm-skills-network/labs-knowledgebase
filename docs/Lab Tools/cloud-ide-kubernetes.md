This learning environment is called "Cloud IDE", it is Theia-based, offering functionalities like file/folder management, a terminal, and more. It operates on a Ubuntu foundation and is enabled for working with Docker and Kubernetes.

### Layout

#### Right side: 
The Cloud IDE development environment resides here, providing the tools for code development and execution.

#### Left side: 
This area is divided into two sections:
 - Tai's Chat Interface: This interface facilitates communication between the learner and Tai, featuring chat history, and learners' message input field.
 - Lab instructions: These instructions guide learners through the learning activities and exercises.

## Cloud IDE Features

Cloud IDE empowers learners with a comprehensive IDE experience, including:
 - File/folder management: Organize and manage files and folders efficiently.
