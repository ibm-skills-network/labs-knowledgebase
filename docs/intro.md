# Introduction

Welcome to the **Skills Network Labs Knowledgebase**. Labs are hands-on learning activities designed to help you practice and apply the concepts you learn in a course. They provide an interactive environment where you can write, test, and run code, experiment with tools, and complete exercises that reinforce your understanding.

Labs allow you to:

- Practice hands-on coding and development in a real or simulated environment.
- Apply theoretical knowledge through practical exercises and projects.
- Experiment with different programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
- Use integrated development environments (IDEs) to write, test, and debug code.
- Access terminals or command lines to run commands and scripts.
- Work with databases, cloud services, containers, or orchestration platforms depending on the lab focus.
- Follow step-by-step instructions to complete tasks and build solutions.
