# Troubleshooting

**Application Proxy Errors:**
If you encounter an error message like "Error occurred while trying to proxy: [IP address]:[port]/" (for example, "Error occurred while trying to proxy: 172.17.52.96:8888/"), this typically indicates that the application you're trying to access is not running or not properly configured. Here's how to resolve this:

1. **Refresh the Application:** Click the small refresh icon at the top of the application's page to reload the app.

2. **Follow Instructions Properly:** Make sure you are following the lab instructions correctly and not accessing read-only pages. Read-only pages don't have running applications behind them, which can cause proxy errors.

**General Server Errors:**
For other server-related errors:
- Simply refresh the entire page in your browser
- If the problem persists, try restarting your application from the terminal
- Otherwise, ask to open a support ticket 

**Application Not Loading:**
If your application fails to load or displays errors:
- Verify that you have completed all prerequisite steps in the lab instructions
- Check the terminal for any error messages
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed
- Restart your application and try again
- Otherwise, ask to open a support ticket
