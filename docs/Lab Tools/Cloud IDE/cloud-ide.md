# Cloud IDE

Cloud IDE is an online integrated development environment that closely mimics Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It offers users a familiar interface and functionality, making it accessible to those already comfortable with VS Code. This cloud-based platform supports VS Code plugins and provides a comprehensive set of development tools. Users can access their development environment from any location, eliminating the need for local installation. Cloud IDE is designed as a learning environment, but the skills and familiarity gained here are directly transferable to Visual Studio Code. This design ensures that learners can easily transition from educational projects to professional development work, bridging the gap between learning and real-world application in the software development industry.
